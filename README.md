# Python Beginner Projects ðŸŽ‰

Hello! Welcome to my Python Beginner Projects repository. I'm new to Python and coding, so I created this space to share some simple projects that have helped me learn. If youâ€™re just starting out like me, I hope these projects will be helpful to you too!

## Introduction

Since Iâ€™m a beginner, these projects are pretty simple, but they cover a lot of the basic concepts in Python, such as:

- Variables and data types
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions
- Working with files

Iâ€™m learning as I go, so Iâ€™ll keep adding new projects as I discover more about Python. If youâ€™re learning too, feel free to try them out, and maybe we can learn together!



### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Git along with a GitHub account created
Any Code Editor, RECOMMENDED: Visual Studio Code
Node.js and npm (if applicable)
Any specific tools/libraries your project relies on.

- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. **Frok this repository**:
2. Clone your forked repository to your PC by first clicking on 'Code' on your Forked Repo, then copy the URL shown there. The URL should look like the following with your GitHub username in place of <your-username> :

 
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hardik25-iso/python-beginner-projects.git


3. **Navigate to a project folder** and follow the instructions there.

### Running the Projects

To run a project, just navigate to its folder and type:

```bash
python project_name.py
```

If you run into any issues, let me know!

## Project List

Here are the projects Iâ€™ve worked on so far:

1. **Guess the Number** - A guessing game where you try to figure out the number the computer picks.

2. **Calculator** - A basic calculator that can do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3. **Rock, Paper, Scissors** - Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer!

More projects will come as I keep learning and experimenting!
